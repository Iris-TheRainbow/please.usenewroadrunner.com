                <i>PLEASE</i> use Road Runner 1.0
            </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 120%;">
                Road Runner 0.5 has now been replaced by Road Runner 1.0, released in late 2023.
                Road Runner 1.0 has some major new features
                like a new command-based system known as Actions,
                faster and more automated tuning, improved path following,
                as well as many fixed bugs.
                <br><br>
                If you have used the guide at <a href="https://learnroadrunner.com">learnroadrunner.com</a>, you are using Road Runner 0.5. 
                The official documentation for Road Runner 1.0 can be found at <a href="https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/installation/">rr.brott.dev.</a>
                <br><br><br>
                The major differences include:
                <br><br>
                1. A <i>HUGE</i> overhaul to the tuning process, making it much faster to perform and much less buggy.
                Tuning 1.0 can take less than an hour and does not require manually tuning Feedforward.
                <br><br>
                2. Much fewer bugs and reduced jank.
                For example, trajectory building no longer takes a ridiculous amount of time
                and trajectory continuity exceptions can no longer occur.
                <br><br>
                3.  An entire command-based system known as Actions to replace markers.
